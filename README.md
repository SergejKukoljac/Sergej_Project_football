# Sergej_Project_football
This is a project where I worked with football data to analyse transfer money, squadvalues and betting odds. 
As I am passionate about sports and data, I thought it would be a great combination for a project. Google Bigquery, SQL and Python were used to clean the data. 
Python was also used to do some extra analysis and build a random forrest regression model. Then Looker Studio was used to visualise the analysis.
Enjoy!
